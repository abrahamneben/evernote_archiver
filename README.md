# evernote_archiver

Evernote is a conventient way to keep track of code, plots, thoughts, half-results, etc. I've been
using it as a digital lab notebook for data analyses for years. Unfortunately there are occasionally
bugs and outages on Evernote's servers, and I don't like the idea of having to rely on the Evernote 
client continuing to exist for years to come.

My proposal is that when you finish a project (i.e., a notebook), export its notes to HTML
using the built in export command, then run this script to produce an Evernote-like interface
for viewing those notes. This interface uses HTML/CSS/JS, and it will be supported long after
Evernote ceases to exist.
